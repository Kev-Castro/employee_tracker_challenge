## Features

When running NODE in the terminal, it will prompt you with questions. 

- These questions have been created to look at all different tables, even tables within tables. 

- By clicking on the buttons, they will ask you if you want to view something or add something. 

    - In this case it is about a business, you can view, or add a department, role, or employee.

- You can also exit the program at any given time by simply pressing enter on Exit the Program prompt.
